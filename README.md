# sports-team-merchandise-app

Objectives:

    Database design
    Practice using SQLAlchemy

Task:

    Create an application to manage merchandise sales for a tour. Soccer sport team selling jerseys and hats.
    The application should use a database to persistently store data.  Use SQLAlchemy.
     (I recommend the Flask web app framework, it works well with SQLAlchemy)  
    For example, if you create a sports team merchandise app, e.g. for a soccer team. Your app should manage the teams season’s merchandise sale. you might need one table for dates of games, another table to manage merchandise items (e.g. jerseys, hats, posters…) and another table to manage sales of each item from each game.
    You should be able to enter data, and create a table of items for sale. You should also be able to create list of game dates/locations. And, you'll need to add sales data for each game date/location.
    Your program should be able to do some analysis of your choice - for example - at which away game did you sell the most jerseys? What item sells the best, what is the worst?
    If you build the application for a musician, festival tour, convention or other customer, you'll need to adapt it to suit your customer.
    As you build your application, remember to write functions, and create modular, focused classes.
